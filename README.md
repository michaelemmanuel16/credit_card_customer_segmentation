# Customer Clustering with KMeans for a Credit Card Company
This project is an example of customer segmentation for a credit card company using KMeans clustering algorithm. The goal of this project is to cluster customers based on their credit card usage behavior and identify groups with similar characteristics, which can be used for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized product offerings.

## Conclusion
The KMeans clustering algorithm will identify groups of customers with similar credit card usage behavior. The number of clusters is a hyperparameter that can be tuned to optimize the clustering performance.

After clustering, the credit card company can use the cluster labels to segment customers and develop targeted marketing campaigns and personalized product offerings for each group.
